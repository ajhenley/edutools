EduTools is a plugin for IntelliJIDEA, it allows self grading of programs written by students through the creation of unit tests. This repo contains lessons for Core Java and Spring Boot.

In order to preview courses, the Java class under each task's src folder must be named Task.java.

IntelliJ freezes sometimes with this plugin when building the solution or rendering markdown(MD) files.
